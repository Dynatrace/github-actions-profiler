/**
 * This component renders a button which will use an Intent to create a workflow in your Dynatrace environment.
 *
 * We are creating a workflow with three steps:
 *
 * - A trigger that will start your workflow every morning at 9:00
 * - A task 'successrate' that will send a DQL query to your environment.
 * - A task 'sendnotification', that will send a Slack notification to a channel of your choice.
 *

 * In order to use the Slack-Integration, you need to first install add the integration in the Dynatrace Hub:
